    #   N due to the loop condition, at that point the variant is
    #   equal to 0: the lower bound of the variant
    # - MONOTONIC DECREASE: at each iteration, `i` is increased by exactly 1
    #   and the length of lst is constant.
    #   Therefore, the variant N - `i` decreases by exactly one.
    # - FINITE NUMBER OF DECREMENTS: since the variant decreases
    #   monotonically by one at each iteration and N is constant,
    #   the lower bound will be reached at which point the loop ends.
